# Anion-Gap
Python code for calculating the Anion Gap in actual condition
In this code, we define a function calculate_anion_gap that takes three parameters: sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. It calculates the anion gap by subtracting the sum of chloride and bicarbonate from sodium. The calculated anion gap is then returned.

The program prompts the user to enter the values of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. These values are passed as arguments to the calculate_anion_gap function. The resulting anion gap is stored in the variable anion_gap and displayed on the console.

You can run this code and provide the necessary inputs to calculate the anion gap in an actual condition.
