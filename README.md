## Introduction
The Anion Gap is a calculated value used in medicine to assess and diagnose certain medical conditions, particularly acid-base disorders. It provides information about the balance between positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) in the blood.

This repository contains a Python code that calculates the Anion Gap based the values of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. By using this code, you can quickly determine the Anion Gap in an actual condition.

## Installation
To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anion-gap-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate the project directory:
   ```
   cd anion-gap-calculator
   ```
3. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org).
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To calculate the Anion Gap, follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:
   ```
   python calculate_anion_gap.py
   ```
4. The program will prompt you to enter the values of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. Enter the values as requested.
5. After entering the values, the program will calculate the An Gap and display it on the console.

## Explanation
The Anion Gap is calculated using the following formula:

```
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chide + Bicarbonate)
```

- **Sodium**: The concentration of sodium ions in the blood.
- **Chloride** The concentration of chloride ions the blood.
- **Bicarbonate**: The concentration of bicarbonate ions in the blood.

The Anion Gap provides valuable information about acid-base disorders, such as metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. It helps healthcare professionals diagnose and monitor conditions like diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, and more.

By using this code, you can easily calculate the Anion Gap in an actual condition, aiding in the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders.
